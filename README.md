# GSynergy React Web Challenge - Movies Browser

This is my submission for the GSynergy React Web Challenge - Movies Browser. The application is a two-page web app for browsing and searching movies using the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/gettingstarted/introduction).

## Instructions

To run and test the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ASHINAY/GSIV23_Anuja_Nayak.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd GSIV23_Anuja_Nayak`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app locally: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## Elements Demonstrating Proficiency

- **Design Implementation**: I've implemented the UI according to the attached UI specs using React components, following the provided mockups.
- **Routing**: I've utilized common routing libraries to implement navigation between the List and Details pages.
- **API Integration**: I've connected to the TMDB API to retrieve and display upcoming movies, movie details, and search results.
- **State Management**: I've employed a state management library (e.g., Redux) to manage the application's state.
- **Async Operations**: I've effectively handled asynchronous operations when fetching data from the API.
- **Code Structure**: I've organized the code to promote reusability, maintainability, and testability.
- **Responsiveness**: The application's design is responsive with a minimum width of 512 pixels, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: [Live Demo](https://ASHINAY.github.io/GSIV23_Anuja_Nayak/)


## Feedback

I appreciate the opportunity to work on this challenge. Overall, I found it to be a great way to demonstrate my React skills. If I were to provide feedback on the challenge itself, I would suggest adding more specific guidelines on testing, especially regarding the coverage of different test cases.
